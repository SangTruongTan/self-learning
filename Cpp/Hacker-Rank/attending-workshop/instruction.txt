CalculateMaxWorkshops should return 4.

Explanation

The first line denotes n, the number of workshops.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's start time.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's duration.

The student can attend the workshops 0, 1, 3 and 5 without overlap, so CalculateMaxWorkshops returns 4 to main (which then prints 4 to stdout).
