Thank you for filling out a Git bug report!
Please answer the following questions to help us understand your issue.

What did you do before the bug happened? (Steps to reproduce your issue)
Please note that 'ls' command just an example, it's happening with any command.
This is a relatively simple bug. when we double-type a command, like 'ls'. However, in the Ubuntu environment, the command only occurs once when we press the top arrow to use the prior command.
It is identical when using git bash.
Repeat these steps:
Type "ls:Â in git bash.
2. Type "ls" once more.
3. To return to the previous command, use the top arrow.
As you can see, the number of times we type the can command 'ls' does not matter; it only needs to occur once.
Please be aware that the command "ls" is only an example; this can happen with any command.

What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)
It's only need to appear once time and remove duplicated for more convenience.

What happened instead? (Actual behavior)
It's depending on how many times we type that command.

What's different between what you expected and what actually happened?
As described above.

--------------
Solution:
This depends on how your shell is configured.

Look into HISTCONTROL and ignoredups.

You might want something like

  export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups

in ~/.bashrc.
